# Learning about Navigator using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to find the shortest route between two metro stations in the Delhi Metro system using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
This project helped me move from learning the algorithm theoretically to applying it on real-world scale data.

This project is more about learning
